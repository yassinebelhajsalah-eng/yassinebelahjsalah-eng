🛠️ I build small, useful security tools, practice on safe labs, and ship one tiny public deliverable every week — writeups, demos, and micro-audit reports.  
My goal: practical skills (Linux, Python, web security).

---

## 🔭 Current focus
- Web Security (HTTP → XSS → SQLi → Auth/IDOR)  
- bug‑bounty / triage workflow (recon → triage → PoC → report)  
- Recon automation in Python (subdomains, nmap, param discovery, HTML reports)  
- Clean, reproducible writeups and professional one‑page reports

---

## 📦 What I publish here
- `/tools` — tiny Python scripts (recon scaffold, helpers)  
- `/writeups` — short lab writeups with TL;DR, PoC, remediation  
- `/reports` — redacted, engagement‑style sample reports (lab based)  
- `/notes` — cheat sheets, payload playbooks, quick commands  
- `/assets` — demo GIFs and screenshots

---

## ⭐ Starter projects
- Recon CLI (Python) — domain → subdomains → nmap → dir‑fuzz → single‑page HTML report  

## 🧰 Core skills & tools
- Languages: Python (automation), Bash, Html/Css, PHP, SQL  
- Tools: Burp Suite, nmap, ffuf, subfinder/amass, Wireshark  
- Labs: PortSwigger, TryHackMe, HTB retired, VulnHub  
- Workflow: recon → triage → PoC → report → follow-up

---

## 💼 Services I offer (small & ethical)
- 1‑hour tutoring — Linux & pentesting basics (terminal + tooling)  
- Micro‑audit — Recon + 1‑page remediation report (fixed price)  
- Report walk‑through — 30–60 minute consult to explain findings

If you want a quick demo or to hire me for a micro‑audit, open an issue in this repo or message me on GitHub.
